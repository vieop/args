argparse requires that all "optional" options are prefixed with a
special prefix character (usually '-'), and that other options are
either positional, or 'subcommands' handled by subparsers

If subparser(s) are supplied, the argument branching into the subparser is
required...that is, one cannot have command --switch *and* command subcommand;
once subcommand is added as a subparser, it must be supplied.  Optional
subparsers have been requested as a feature, but not yet.
